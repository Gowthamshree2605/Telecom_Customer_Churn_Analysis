# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis in Python

**Python-based Telecom Customer Churn Analysis using 7,043 records to identify churn drivers, segment patterns, and retention strategies.**

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This **Python project** analyzes **7,043 telecom customer records** to uncover **churn patterns**, **customer behavior**, and **key drivers of attrition** using demographic, service, and billing data.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- High churn impacts revenue & customer lifetime value  
- Lack of data-driven insights into churn causes  
- Retention efforts are not targeted or effective  

---

## 🚀 Objectives
1. Identify major factors influencing churn  
2. Measure churn rate across segments & contract types  
3. Predict potential churners using customer attributes  
4. Provide **actionable recommendations** to reduce churn
